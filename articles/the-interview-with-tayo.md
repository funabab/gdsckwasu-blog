Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Tayo

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How are you doing today?

Tayo (oshomo): I'm doing very well.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly introduce yourself

Tayo (oshomo): My name is Adebakin Temitayo
I'm a Kwara State University computer science student and also a Product Designer

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for that. So let’s get right into it.
You recently secured an internship with Renmoney, how did that happen?

Tayo (oshomo): It was through a link Fathi got. Fathi was supposed to register for this, but he had already gotten a placement at a place we were struggling to get into, which in the long run they later accepted me as well. Although, Fathi wasn’t aware of the company that needed an intern then because it wasn't stated.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay. So you just got the link and applied.

Tayo (oshomo): Yes basically. I just applied. Although I was skeptical due to a bunch of rejections I had gotten before that link. Hell...I was not even planning on registering 😂. I just took my shot and sent in my cover letter and cv with my portfolio, and did the interview.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Nice! What is your role at Renmoney?

Tayo (oshomo): My role first was QA (Quality Assurance) or we call them software testers.
So before any product or feature is launched, it goes right through them for testing. So we use qase to run a test and Jira to either file new tickets or work on the one being filed to the QA guys before I recently moved to the Product Department.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Did you have any experience with QA before that?

Tayo (oshomo): Nope, I didn't. I basically learned on the job.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Nice. How challenging was that?

Tayo (oshomo): Mehnnn it was crazy for the first couple of weeks but the mentors assigned to us were really good and understanding. So the first couple of weeks was more like lecturing on how to use the product. They Introduced us as well to their internal products and the like.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That must have really helped. Is it a paid role?

Tayo (oshomo): Yes ooooo💯😂🤲🏾

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol 😅

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Let’s talk about the recruitment process. What was it like? And what do you think made the recruiter put a ‘yes’ to it for you?

Tayo (oshomo): The recruitment was really good because I got the recruiter talking about their products. And he liked my CV.
I told him about what might need improvement on their product, starting from usability, and so on.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You offered value.

Tayo (oshomo): Exactly.

Tayo (oshomo): To the point when I resumed. All he could remember me as was the product guy.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh lol. ‘The Product guy’

Tayo (oshomo): I'm telling you😂🤲🏾

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Does this sort of internship require you to have some years of experience in the industry?

Tayo (oshomo): Hmmm not really. Just do your research about the product and show how much you can impact their company if they hire you.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay. Thank you for the insight.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, how are you finding the product design role?

Tayo (oshomo): Interesting...really interesting.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What value have you been able to deliver so far?

Tayo (oshomo): First it was a struggle as well when I switched to the Product department, because I struggled to find my footing, and they’ve got very very good designers. So it is more of them impacting me than I do.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That’s great!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Is there anything else you would like to share? Final words?

Tayo (oshomo): No final words. I wan go sleep😂😂😂🤲🏾

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol alright 😅

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for your time and for sharing your experience.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Have a great day!

Tayo (oshomo): Thank youuuuuuuuu

Aliyyah Kalejaye: 😅
