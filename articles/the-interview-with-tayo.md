Hello Techy!

One thing every beginner struggles with after putting in so much time and effort into learning, is securing an internship. It seems like all the shots you shoot turns out to be a miss, and the ones that seem to come through never fully come through. At some point, you start taking up whatever is offered to you, do a lot of free work and barely ever shoot your shot at big organisations anymore because ‘rejection don tire you’.

You ask yourself at this point, ‘What am I doing wrong?’ ‘What should I do better?’. You even start attending tech events to shoot your shot physically. For some of us, we land good roles, but for the rest of us, ‘rejection lanje’ lol.

This is why I decided to interview ‘The Product guy’ - TAYO of Renmoney on how he was able to secure an internship with a company like Renmoney. Good News is, it’s not rocket science. He did the first thing we all do, he applied!

I don’t want to give spoilers, so here is how the interview with Tayo went;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Tayo

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How are you doing today?

Tayo of Remnoney: I'm doing very well.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly introduce yourself

Tayo of Renmoney: My name is Adebakin Temitayo
I'm a Kwara State University computer science student and also a Product Designer

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for that. So let’s get right into it.
You recently secured an internship with Renmoney, how did that happen?

Tayo of Renmoney: It was through a link Fathi got. Fathi was supposed to register for this, but he had already gotten a placement at a place we were struggling to get into, which in the long run they later accepted me as well. Although, Fathi wasn’t aware of the company that needed an intern then because it wasn't stated.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay. So you just got the link and applied.

Tayo of Renmoney: Yes basically. I just applied. Although I was sceptical due to a bunch of rejections I had gotten before that link. Hell...I was not even planning on registering 😂. I just took my shot and sent in my cover letter and cv with my portfolio, and did the interview.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Nice! What is your role at Renmoney?

Tayo of Renmoney: My role first was QA (Quality Assurance) or we call them software testers.
So before any product or feature is launched, it goes right through them for testing. So we use qase to run a test and Jira to either file new tickets or work on the one being filed to the QA guys before I recently moved to the Product Department.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Did you have any experience with QA before that?

Tayo of Renmoney: Nope, I didn't. I basically learned on the job.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Nice. How challenging was that?

Tayo of Renmoney: Mehnnn it was crazy for the first couple of weeks but the mentors assigned to us were really good and understanding. So the first couple of weeks was more like lecturing on how to use the product. They Introduced us as well to their internal products and the likes.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That must have really helped. Is it a paid role?

Tayo of Renmoney: Yes ooooo💯😂🤲🏾

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol 😅

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Let’s talk about the recruitment process. What was it like? And what do you think made the recruiter put a ‘yes’ to it for you?

Tayo of Renmoney: The recruitment was really good because I got the recruiter talking about their products. And he liked my CV.
I told him about what might need improvement on their product, starting from usability, and so on.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You offered value.

Tayo of Renmoney: Exactly. To the point when I resumed. All he could remember me as was the product guy.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh lol. ‘The Product guy’

Tayo of Renmoney: I'm telling you😂🤲🏾

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Does this sort of internship require you to have some years of experience in the industry?

Tayo of Renmoney: Hmmm not really. Just do your research about the product and show how much you can impact their company if they hire you.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay. Thank you for the insight.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, how are you finding the product design role?

Tayo of Renmoney: Interesting...really interesting.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What value have you been able to deliver so far?

Tayo of Renmoney: First it was a struggle as well when I switched to the Product department, because I struggled to find my footing, and they’ve got very very good designers. So it is more of them impacting me than I do.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That’s great!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Is there anything else you would like to share? Final words?

Tayo of Renmoney: No final words. I wan go sleep😂😂😂🤲🏾

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lol alright 😅

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for your time and for sharing your experience.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Have a great day!

Tayo of Renmoney: Thank youuuuuuuuu

Aliyyah Kalejaye: 😅
