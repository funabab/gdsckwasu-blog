Hello Techy!
Today, I present to you the one and only, Meje!!! A GOAT and more!!! A man of cassava and Agbado!!! The aspiring farmer!!!

See there are a lot more accolades and you will pick them up as you proceed in this article but let‚Äôs pause here for the sake of moving forward.

In previous articles and Newsletters from this community, GDSC KWASU, you‚Äôve probably heard the name Zayin, Seven, Meje, and even Daddy Mulika being thrown around.

I am pleased to inform you that it‚Äôs just one person that owns all these accolades (see what I was saying about the accolades) and that‚Äôs the person I interviewed this week.

We had a very interesting conversation about so many things, and I had a tad-bit too much fun lol. This is how it went;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Meje!

Caleb Olojo: Hey Aliyyah!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly tell the world who you are.

Caleb Olojo: Ah! The whole world?...

Okay, so here's how it is, first off I'm a person. People don't think I am, that's why I had to put it out here again, and I do stuff related to Developer Education on the internet. In layman terms, it means I like to do free work on the internet by sharing my knowledge around Software (Frontend) Engineering. Most importantly, I'm a Farmer. Why? Because _"farmers will make more money"_

Aliyyah Kalejaye: This is a very interesting intro, lol

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Where should we start? Your Aerospace Engineering degree maybe?

Caleb Olojo: Ah! That degree?

Well... I think we should give it a shot, because it'll be a rollercoaster of me ranting and ranting and ranting incessantly!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okayyyy, I can definitely relate. Let‚Äôs hope we can get closure soon üòÖ

Caleb Olojo: That idea of closure? Dang!! I pray I attain it sooner!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Sameeee

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What‚Äôs it like studying Aerospace Engineering in Nigeria? ‚Ä¶or atleast, what was it like for you?

Caleb Olojo: What's it like for me? Uhmm... lemme start like this; WARRR!!!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Really? Lol. Why?

Caleb Olojo: I love the course, or at least I thought I did, till I met some people that I'd never pray my worst enemies ‚Äî yes, I have enemies ‚Äì have an encounter with. I think the only time I enjoyed being a student in that department was in year two.

Year one was a total waste of time for me! Engr. Mayowa was the real deal for majority of the folks in my circle, in year two. Man went down to the atoms of the industry with us.

Like... one moment you're busy calculating for the maximum velocity that a HTA (Heavier Than Air) aircraft will need to maximize its Rate of Climb, the next moment you're at the top of [Mount Sobi](https://www.google.com/search?q=mount%20sobi%20ilorin%20kwara&oq=mount+sobi+ilorin+kwara&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2.6972j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&tbs=lf:1,lf_ui:1&tbm=lcl&sxsrf=ALiCzsa_uHSeB2WClo7g85O6I93zHd5Kvg:1671554295209&rflfq=1&num=10&rldimm=16739191157922461097&lqi=Chdtb3VudCBzb2JpIGlsb3JpbiBrd2FyYUjV6-ri17WAgAhaIRAAGAEYAhgDIhdtb3VudCBzb2JpIGlsb3JpbiBrd2FyYZIBC2hpa2luZ19hcmVhmgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVIxZFdGUFRsSm5FQUWqAQ0QASoJIgVtb3VudCgA&phdesc=_6M6KAnhYkM&ved=2ahUKEwjNiPT_0Ij8AhU5i_0HHRr-By8QvS56BAgLEAE&sa=X&rlst=f#rlfi=hd:;si:16739191157922461097,l,Chdtb3VudCBzb2JpIGlsb3JpbiBrd2FyYUjV6-ri17WAgAhaIRAAGAEYAhgDIhdtb3VudCBzb2JpIGlsb3JpbiBrd2FyYZIBC2hpa2luZ19hcmVhmgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVIxZFdGUFRsSm5FQUWqAQ0QASoJIgVtb3VudCgA,y,_6M6KAnhYkM;mv:[[8.985,4.9156667],[8.3316667,4.0009999999999994]];tbs:lrf:!1m4!1u3!2m2!3m1!1e1!1m4!1u2!2m2!2m1!1e1!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:1), testing locally made radio controlled gliders!

It was nice, until it wasn't!

Caleb Olojo: I actually still do love the course. Just that the folks I met during my time there... Nada.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Great to know you had a great time at some point.
I guess things won‚Äôt always be rosy.

Caleb Olojo: I know right! üòé

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Do you see a connection between your interests in the Aerospace world and what you do in tech?

Caleb Olojo: Yeah yeah, I doüòÉ

At a point in time I had to dive into Geospatial analysis with JavaScript ‚Äî my arch enemy! ‚Äî for the sake of analysing data that an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) would be interfacing with.

Even my final-year thesis was somewhat related to punching some bunch of commands onto an arduino hardware through its firmware to control a multi-rotor system.

Although my role revolved around creating a CAD model of the system with a design tool, It was easy to contribute to the algorithms that'll control the system since I have a background in programming.
The code was written in C. I freaking have an history with C. üò≠

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Interesting. You seem to have gone through the design, control, and programming phase, that‚Äôs a lot.

Can you share your story with C? I‚Äôm curious lol.

Caleb Olojo: Ah! I don't even know where to start. A lot of folks said it isn't that hard BTW. But, I'd definitely place my bet on Rust, for its compilation prowess, even if it seems a little bit complex.

I still remember contributing to a Rust-based open source project, and the first thing I got was a wave of headaches when I opened the codebase. Had to Japa üòÇ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay, this is a lot of technical terms and I am confused.
Can you explain to me like I am five?

Caleb Olojo: Oh shite! Sorry about that.

One of the (many) reasons why C has so many early adopters is the ability for C to be able to do stuff without wasting so much memory space. This somehow translates to the amount of time it takes for a block of code to be executed.

But, Rust does it better. Below is a quote I'm grabbing from a research. Pardon me for the technical terms again! ü§≤üèΩü§≤üèΩ

_‚ÄúRust incorporates a memory ownership model enforced at a compile time. Since this model involves zero runtime overhead, programs written in Rust are not only memory-safe but also fast, leading to performance comparable to C and C++‚Äù_

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohhh now it makes sense.

So you are saying, C and Rust can be used to solve the same problems but Rust helps to save up on memory and is also fast, if I am right?

Caleb Olojo: Yep, basically.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How does that connect to the history you have with C?

Caleb Olojo: "Real Engineers will always write C", said _"person A"_ &mdash; sorry I redacted the name. Very annoying shite!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What language do you currently write then?

Caleb Olojo: JavaScript.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I thought that was your arch enemy? Why JavaScript?!

Caleb Olojo: What can I do without it? üòÇ

JavaScript is the only thing preventing me from becoming a fulltime farmer! By now, I'd probably be in my village cultivating cassava.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh you want to be cultivating ‚ÄòAgbado‚Äô, cassava, and so on?

Caleb Olojo: Exactly! If not for JavaScript, that's probably what I'd be doing by now.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hmm I see you becoming a passionate farmer soon.

Caleb Olojo: I hope so too! üòÇ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You mentioned earlier that you are into developer education on the internet, how do you go about that?

Caleb Olojo: Developer Education as the name implies, is, Education for Software Developers, and in this ecosystem, I focus on educating/teaching or talking about web performance, a little bit about user-experience, the JAMStack, and Frontend Engineering in general.

You can find a lot of my contributions in this ecosystem on my [blog](https://meje.dev/blog)

Caleb Olojo: ...and other [publications](https://meje.dev/articles);

Aliyyah Kalejaye: This is amazing!!! You have a blog of your own, and other notable publications? Cut soap for me!!!

Caleb Olojo: Lmao! No be so o üòÇ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Naso ohh boss üòÖ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How long have you been writing for?

Caleb Olojo: Wrote [my first piece in April of 2020](https://dev.to/seven/react-app-with-parcel-25e9). So I think I can say Two years and some months now.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Respectable growth so far! Welldone!

Caleb Olojo: Ayyy!! Thank you! ü§üüèΩ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Being a previous GDSC lead, what are your thoughts on community development?

Caleb Olojo: Omorr! Why does this sound as though I'm being asked for my manifesto üòÉ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lmao üòÇ. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to sound that way.

Caleb Olojo: Two things though;

- it is a chain reaction of contribution from everyone. The community isn't for the lead alone. It is for every member of that community.
  Everyone has to take full ownership, not minding if they're core team members or not. It is a mindset like this that places the community on a path towards exponential growth.
- Avoid allocating blame.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Wisdom of the old! Bestow thy wisdom upon me!

The community is for every member of the community. That says ‚Äòinclusiveness‚Äô to me.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Finally, I hear your Alias is Daddy Mulika, how is Mulika doing and how do you combine raising Mulika with tech? Do you get support from your sugar mommy/ies?

Caleb Olojo: Which wisdom? üòÇ

The way you phrase these questions ehnn! First off... I'm no longer Daddy Mulika, that's because Ionware took the title from me!

Second off, all my sugar mummies left me. They all said I don't have money again. How ironic can that be, right?

Betrayal of the highest order!!!

I can see that my young lads have started treading my path. Hell, some of them are even using ChatGPT to compose love letters to their sugar mummies. I laugh at them üòÇ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That must be heartbreaking, I deeply sympathise with you.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Good to know you have prot√©g√©es. Please inform them of the dangers ahead and don‚Äôt just laugh at them.

Caleb Olojo: Nah...I'm not informing anybody of anything. Let them deep their feet in the proverbial waters.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I believe you have thought long and hard enough before coming to this resolution. So, I will leave you to it!

Caleb Olojo: Lmao! I didn't think about anything.
Just made the decision not to.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lmao ü§£. Okay.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you so much for making time for this and sharing your experience and everything else.

Caleb Olojo: t'was niceee having this conversation with you.

Thank you for having me üòé

This is where I take a bow today, people. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as we enjoyed having this conversation.
