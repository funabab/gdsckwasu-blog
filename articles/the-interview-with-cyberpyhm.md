Hello Techy!

You will agree that creating and putting out a product -tangible or intangible- can be very tasking. The question you have to keep asking is, â€˜How will whoever interacts with this product feel?'. Let us take a website for example; from the UI design - User Interface design, to the Frontend, down to the backend, and even the UX writing, the product manager keeps ensuring that this question is answered effectively.

This is why I interviewed a Product designer in the person of Jimoh Lawal -A.K.A Cyberphym on this weeks' episode of THE INTERVIEWS with GDSC KWASU, on how he effectively ensures positive User Experience (UX) through design.

The interview went like this;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Cyberphym!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly introduce yourself

Cyberphym: My name is Lawal

I'm a Product Designer (UI, UX, Graphics, and Brand design)
I enjoy community development and football.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You must be watching the ongoing World Cup, what are your thoughts on it so far?

Cyberphym: So far, I'm on the happy side. My favorite team and player are still on, and my least favorite team and player just got eliminated ðŸ™‚.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh wow. Messi and Argentina fan lol.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Letâ€™s get back on track. How long have you been designing?

Cyberphym: Professionally about 3 years +. But as a hubby, all my life.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Now I have to say wow again. All your life? Please share your journey.

Cyberphym: Lol

Cyberphym: Well, basically I've always been fascinated by design.

Growing up in an environment like Ilasamaja (Isolo), there was always a lot going on and I'm always fascinated by art and abstract things even though my life is always busy.

I've always had a thing or two for design, I do a few hand drawings here and there (but I am not quite good with the pen). But digital arts has been something I wanted to do.

I can remember whenever I got the chance to work on a computer, I would open the photo paint app and practice designing things. But it was all for fun then.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Amazing!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How has the professional journey been for you?

Cyberphym: As I said earlier, I have always been fascinated by design and one of my other passion is community development because of my upbringing and community.

While I was at the polytechnic, I couldn't do much, but when I got to the university and learned about UX design through DSC, I knew this was what I wanted to do. I got to understand you can solve problems using design and research.

And so far, it has been a bit of up and downs. But, glory is to God, we steady grinding.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Great!
What would you say a good design is?

Cyberphym: A good design is a functional design

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Functional in what sense?

Cyberphym: Despite its aesthetics and all, it has to be able to solve the problem.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Right!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What is the first you do when you want to start working on a design?

Cyberphym: Research research research

Cyberphym: I research about everything, even the basic things.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay, why research?

Cyberphym: Research is the basic fundamental of design.

As a designer, whenever I have to create a design, I don't just take the mouse/pen and start designing. I have to research the problem, the users, then the existing and possible solutions.

Doing this, I will get to;

- Understand what the problem is
- Understand how the problem affects the user
- Understand how the user has been relating with already existing solutions (if any)

That will make it easier for me to make decisions, as to what to design.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So you are saying just by carrying out research, you get to understand all of these and design something that billions of users will interact with effectively?

Cyberphym: Exactly! And more so, there is this saying that.
The more time you spend carrying research, the less time you will spend designing.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okay, this is enlightening.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Finally, for beginners like me who might be interested in design, can you please give a road map to building a career as a designer?

Cyberphym: Hmmm
Like the great JK often says,â€˜This life no get manual'.

Cyberphym: But I will say;

- Be open-minded
- Ask questions
- Commitment and consistent practice

These are the things that will keep you going.

Cyberphym: If you're more interested in UX design, take courses on that aspect of design.

But usually, it's always cool to start with learning the visuals because there is this fulfillment in creating something visually appealing which will drive you harder to learn the UX aspects to be able to create not just aesthetically good designs, but also functional design.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for that!!!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Anything else you would like to share? Any final words?

Cyberphym: I will say, try as much as possible to enjoy what you are doing. Regardless of how hard it can be at times.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Profound!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for your time and sharing your knowledge and experience.

Cyberphym: My pleasure. Thank you for having me

Aliyyah Kalejaye: My pleasure

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you for answering the call of the community!

Cyberphym: Na our community ðŸ™‚

Aliyyah Kalejaye: ðŸ’¯
