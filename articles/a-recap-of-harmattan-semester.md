Hey Techie!

This article is a summary of the just concluded semester at GDSC KWASU. As you know, it is important that we keep track of our progress, activities, and shortcomings to plan for the next semester better and to experience undiluted growth _wink emeoji_.

This article will be taking us through our major event for the just concluded semester, our meet up, and our highlights for the semester.
Here they are:

## Information Session

The info session as it is mostly called is an annual session where the essence of the community, the role that the community plays currently in the campus environment, and how you can be part of the community is introduced.

The info session is usually the first event for the semester. That is when new incubees (as we fondly call them) &mdash; don't know what incubees are? Think about newbies &mdash; are enlightened about the various stacks (I.e career paths) in the tech ecosystem.

They get to choose which one works for them, and we help them get started on that journey by providing them with resources, mentors, and weekly meet ups.

Our last information session happened on Wednesday, 12th of January, 2022, at the Faculty of ICT lab on campus.

We had eight speakers from different stacks. Each session was knowledge and value packed and we had fun. Of course there was snacks on ground.

The photo session was beautiful. We had drone shots and they were breathtaking. I missed the drone shots because of class though and I was sad when I saw how beautiful the pictures were.

Tip: make sure you don’t miss photo seasons at tech events, IG worthy pictures, trust me so you can pepper your haturrs (Read in Bobrisky's voice).

## Awesome weekly Meetups

At GDSC KWASU, we hold weekly meet ups. They hold every Friday till the end of the semester. The aim of these meet ups are for; trainings, group practice, brainstorming, resource distribution, and obviously debugging (lol).

We had about eight meet ups in the just concluded semester, but one meet up stood out for us. The one that was held at Malete Secondary School’s compound, under the trees.

If I don't give you the tea, who will?
Due to fuel scarcity, we had issues with transportation, so we couldn’t get shuttles to transport us on campus.

The lead sent out a memo for us to meet at Malete secondary school. A lot of people showed up, and it turned out to be a fire meetup.

We discussed everything we could think about in tech. From various stacks, fintech, latest technology updates, how to Japa update, and so on.

You can say it was an enlightening meetup. It was also our highlight for the semester.

As we are a community, we would love for you to invite other techies, newbies and enthusiasts generally to the community.

So long, folks!
