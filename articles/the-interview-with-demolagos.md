Hello Techy!

Glad you found your way here!

I‚Äôm sure you are wondering what these interviews are about. Like what is **‚ÄúTHE INTERVIEW with GDSC KWASU‚Äù**? What are you supposed to expect?

Truth is, this can take difeerent turns as time goes on, but one thing I can tell you is to expect a touch of everything.

Everything as in, every aspect of tech, every track, beginner to intermediate to senior, solving real life issues, securing interships, the money talk, technical writing, being Daddy Mulika, and everthing else you can think of.

Just like you, I am also looking forward to the different turns this initiative will take, and I hope you will join me every wednesday on this ride.

Today, I am here to share with you the first interview session I conducted with **Ajijola Ademola** (A.K.A DemolaLagos).

In this interview, just like the topic says, we discussed being a techy/PM, and the need for you to make books your friend. He also recommended a few books, and his final words is a great conversation starter, as you will read later on in this article.

The interview went this way;

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Hi Demola

**DemolaLagos**: Hello

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: So, our main focus for this interview is to discuss your career as a PM/tech person and how reading has made an impact in your career

**DemolaLagos**: Okay ‚úÖ

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Kindly introduce yourself and what you do.

**DemolaLagos**: I am Ademola Ajijola, I am a Product Manager and I make people happy.
**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Lol nice.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Who is a Product manager?

**DemolaLagos**: Well, there is no core defined definition but there are certain things Product Manager does that makes a person a product Manager.
A Product Manager identifies the customer needs or basically delivers value to the customer.
Exactly why I said I make people happy, when you deliver value, you make them happy.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Great! Happiness is key.
I believe we all like being happy.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: What do you do as a product manager?

**DemolaLagos**: It depends on my role basically and basically where you work.
Each company defines what product management means to them.
Majorly, I deliver business across growth metrics ( retention, revenue etc ).
Most times also I work with internal stakeholders ( engineering etc ) to deliver specifications and functionalities.
All in the same circle of managing the entire product cycle.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: So you are an all-rounder?

**DemolaLagos**: It is just Nigeria and maybe being a product manager makes you more of a generalist working with specialists. Well, it is different in a well structured system but you define who you want to be actually.
I have been running some data courses for last few months now.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Why the data courses?

**DemolaLagos**: To scale products using data and most importantly to be data smart.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Which in turn makes you a better PM, if I am right?

**DemolaLagos**: Yes, but obviously I won‚Äôt be a PM forever.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: So, you have plans of crossing professions?

**DemolaLagos**: Yes, obviously.
I don‚Äôt know yet maybe investment and finance or something, but I am obviously looking forward to doing more than building or managing products.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Hmm interesting.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: How many products have you managed?

**DemolaLagos**: Well this 2022, I have worked on a travel product with a travel tech company, from start to launch ( this is my biggest flex and generated over 2.4B in 100 days ) &mdash; this took the first 6 months of this year.

I have worked on a SME financing product.

Correctly working on a decentralized transport finance for logistics in africa & a Crypto exchange app.
So I will say 4 this year but I did one or two with few startups but they failed.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Wow that‚Äôs big. Welldone

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: When you say ‚Äòthey failed‚Äô what does that mean?

**DemolaLagos**: They couldn‚Äôt attain some certain metrics for product success.
Investors pulled out because of certain issues also.
There are different reasons why products fail also.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Okay. Now I understand.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Let‚Äôs track back a little, how did you come around being in tech, and then becoming a product manager?

**DemolaLagos**: Oh well, I think it a long time but basically around 2016 or so. I laid my hands on code and actually met several people. 2017 I worked with some few guys from FUTA on a FB accelerator program (Upnepa) as a project manager and coordinator and 2019 I started doing product management bit by bit and doing more learnings also.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: So you started with coding, then project management, and then product management.

**DemolaLagos**: Yes, but I actually tested my hands on few things like cyber security, digital marketing and I did 6 months Product design with Utiva.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: That must have been a long journey to self discovery.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: I see you talking about books a lot on your Instagram. What‚Äôs the need to read as a techy/Product manager?

**DemolaLagos**: Like I tell people, I have been investing in books a lot this year and someone close to me got me 20 books for my birthday. Reading opens your mind to a lot of things which can accelerate your career.

You are as a result of the information around you. When you are reading a book of someone with 25 years experience in Product Management.
You are learning from that person‚Äôs experience so you don‚Äôt make his mistakes, instead you make fresh mistakes.
You have to understand experience is the currency of a product manager but what if you have the experience and you read also. Well, it is amazing.
I can‚Äôt guarantee one book will give you what you want, but I can guarantee continuous reading will.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: I totally agree.
20 books as birthday gift? God when.

**DemolaLagos**: Yes, I think it is amazing because I can actually relate with them and be fluent to certain level.

**DemolaLagos**: Admin got me books also (I prefer not to disclose the numbers).

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Okay, that‚Äôs nice.
I want to be like you when I grow up.

**DemolaLagos**: Lol üòÇ
I am not making $200K so you can be like others

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Lol
I will still keep you on the list üòÖ

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: For someone who is into tech and just wants to start reading, which book will you recommend?

**DemolaLagos**: Well there are alot of books
But I will recommend few introductory books which include; Product Management for dummies, Product Management in practice, and the principles of product development.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Who are the authors?

**DemolaLagos**: I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs been a while but I will check out.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Alright. I will appreciate feedback on that.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Any final words?

**DemolaLagos**: You are free to do things for money. Money is a big motivation also.
The world won‚Äôt listen to a broke genius.

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: True!

**Aliyyah Kalejaye**: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your knowledge and experience.

That‚Äôs all with **DemolaLagos** on this week‚Äôs issue on ‚ÄúTHE INTERVIEW with GDSC KWASU‚Äù. It was an amazing and enlightening session for me, and I hope you feel the same way?
