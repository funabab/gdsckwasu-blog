This is just the beginning of the awesome things we're putting together at the Google Developer Student Clubs, KWASU. When the responsibility of leading this community was handed over to us, our community lead tweeted something about "building capacity @KwasuDsc", and I really can't wait to see all of this come to life.

By the end of this tenure, we would have built capacity, and we'd come back and laugh, all of us --- all together.

Cheers to the beginning of greatness!

## Out of curiosity, we ventured unto this quest.

The idea of being able to write about a lot of stuffs, mostly about our community on campus, we envisioned a scenario whereby the members of our community are kept in a constant loop of being informed about the latest developement was what actually birthed the thought process of creating this blog page.

Let's see how it goes.

## So?? why exactly a blog of all things... WHY?

Wooo... Omorrr!! I'm out of ideas. I guess Sherrie would continue from where I stopped. I am just really exicited as I rummage through the codebase of this blog page, trying to attach everything together.
