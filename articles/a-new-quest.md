This is just the beginning of the awesome things we're putting together at the Google Developer Student Clubs, KWASU. When the responsibility of leading this community was handed over to us, our community lead tweeted something about "building capacity @KwasuDsc", and I really can't wait to see all of this come to life.

By the end of this tenure, we would have built capacity, and we'd come back and laugh, all of us &mdash; all together.

Cheers to the beginning of greatness!

## Out of curiosity, we ventured unto this quest.

The idea of being able to write about a lot of stuffs, mostly about our community on campus, we envisioned a scenario whereby the members of our community are kept in a constant loop of being informed about the latest developements was what actually birth the thought process of creating this blog page.

Let's see how it goes.

## So?? why exactly a blog of all things... WHY?

Well... there is this disconnect that the community here &mdash; in Kwara State University &mdash; has been facing for a while now. People hardly even know that there's a State University in Kwara State, talk less of a Community of budding student developers.

So our community lead [Caleb Olojo](https://twitter.com/calebolojo), shared this whole idea of putting the students in community out there for the world to see. By putting us out there, it involves the process of sharing the things that we've learnt over the time, say, for example, in a semester, a session, and perhaps even during the breaks.

The main idea is to be able to keep track of the progress of our students, and at the same time, being able to share such progress with our local community &mdash; the campus community here in Malete &mdash; then we move to the state level, next, to a point where we're recognized at a global level, with people actually recognizing that we have folks who are doing great things from a little place we fondly call _"the wilderness"_.

Recently someone tweeted shared how the University of Lagos is minting tech talents, and there's no doubt about that because it is the truth.

We &mdash; as a community &mdash; want to look back, years from now and be able to beat our chests that we're also building capacity, and we'll continue to build capacity, and world class students/developers who are taking and holding high positions in society!

That, is the mandate that we're willing to put in all our efforts for.
