Hello Techy,

On this week’s episode of THE INTERVIEWS with GDSC KWASU, I interviewed Daddy wa of GDSC KWASU - Fathi Babayeju. He is a Front-end developer with a difference. Okay, I want to be extra but I will get dragged for it lol.

This interview is for you if you are looking to be a part of the HNG internship or looking to secure any internship at all. I have been sharing a lot of internships and aspire to perspire because all of us must Maguire a role in the new year. That‘s if you read up and put into practice the things that these amazing people share with us.

The interview with Daddy wa went like this;
Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Fathi,

Fathi: Hi Aliyyah. Good evening.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly tell us about you and what you do.

Fathi: I’m Fathi, a Frontend Developer who loves building long-lasting solutions related to the web, and I’m a big fan of clean code architecture.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Niceeee

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You are in the current HNG internship cohort right?

Fathi: Yes, I am. Stage 8 presently.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How did you get into the internship?

Fathi: I registered some months back and got a mail when it started.

I think it’s free for all. There’s no restriction to who joins, but people get disqualified if they don’t meet the requirement for getting promoted to the next stage

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Free for all, as in every person from every field? Or just people in tech?

Fathi: Not all tech fields, the tracks here are mobile development, web development (both Frontend and Backend), product design, DevOps, and product/project management. This means it’s for people in tech.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Okayyy thank you for the clarification.

Fathi: You’re welcome

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You are in stage 8, how have you been able to make it this far? You know despite all the challenges, deadlines, and overwhelming tasks that are said to come with the internship.

Fathi: Ómooo,

I’m not the smartest or the best dev in the program but I ensure to complete any task given before the deadline. Aside from my skills, the friends I made brought me this far.

You know one thing in this line of tech is to always speak out and do away with pride abeg, I reach out to people whenever I have issues, and we brainstorm and solve the problem together.

And above all, I’m not the type who gives up easily. Wanted to at a point tho but my friends kept me going

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So, friendships and a fighting spirit have helped you to come this far.

Fathi: Yes yes, together with personal skills and experience.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Great, Welldone!

Fathi: Thanks😁

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How many stages to go or is this the final stage?

Fathi: Two more stages left, the final stage is 10. Already made the submission for stage 9 promotion, hopefully I’ll make it.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Looking forward to seeing you in the next stage!

Fathi: Thank you😅

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Asides from HNG, what else are you into currently?

Fathi: I’m currently working for two startups, Edutech and adTech.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh wow. How do you keep up?

Fathi: Hmmm, I’ll say setting priority right. I mostly run HNG during the day and work at night. It’s draining tho but man just needs to keep grinding.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I want to come and take classes from you after this interview becauseeeeeeeee wowwwwwwww.

Fathi: Haba. It actually affected work but not too much, let’s say I was working 5 hours, it got reduced to 4.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh

Fathi: I think we should actually make people know our worth and value, when you have free time, give in your all to whatever you’re doing so that when something comes up, they can vouch for you.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: True!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What’s your advice to anyone hoping to take the HNG internship in the future?

Fathi: Expect shege pro max, just kidding lol.

You don’t need to be a great tech person to take the program, you just need to have the experience needed. Above all, be ready for mental stress.

HNG hasn’t really stressed me skill-wise (if there’s a word like this sha) but mentally, I was drained. Make friends with interns and mentors, join a good team, and make a positive impact on the team.

Fathi: If I can get here while working with startups, then you can😀.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Alright! Thank you for the insight, and thank you for joining me today, on THE INTERVIEWS with GDSC KWASU.

Fathi: The honor is mine, thank you mummy wa.

Fathi: I’ll be taking buns from you though as I missed World Cup😂.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: My pleasure Daddy wa 🤣

Aliyyah Kalejaye: That’s fine 😂

Fathi: Keep up the good work😂

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Definitely!

That’s all on today’s episode of THE INTERVIEWS with GDSC KWASU. I would like you to note, that when this interview was conducted, Fathi was still in Stage 8 but he made it to the final stage. Secondly, these interviews happen over a WhatsApp conversation, and only grammatical errors are corrected that’s why you see emojis.

Overall, I hope this was a good read for you and you had points to take with you. Make sure to always engage with us on social media, and read the other episodes of the interviews if you haven’t.

Happy Holidays!
