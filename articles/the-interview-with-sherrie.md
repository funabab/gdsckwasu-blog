Hello Techy!

The words â€˜Scienceâ€™ and â€˜Technologyâ€™ have proven to be inseparable for decades now. Yet, some of us still havenâ€™t understood the relationship between the two. Some are even involved in both but treat them as separate entities, and donâ€™t even understand that you can find a balance by understanding the connection between both.

Whichever category you fall into is no longer a problem because you have decided to read this interview. On this one, I interviewed my boss, Sherifat Jimoh -Sherrie of GDSC KWASU!!!

She is a Medical Laboratory Science Student (soon to be inducted), a content writer, and social media manager. She shared with me her unique story on how she found the connection between her interests in the science space and what she does in Tech.

The interview went like this;

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Hi Sherrie

Sherrie: Hello Aliyyah
Good evening.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Kindly introduce yourself

Sherrie: Okay.
My name is Sherifat Oyiza Jimoh but almost everyone calls me Sherrie.
I am a Medical Laboratory Science Student (soon-to-be inducted).
I write content and manage social media accounts.
I am particularly interested in making a change wherever I go and I hate stagnancy or seeing people who lack exposure.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Excellent! Thank you!

Sherrie: You are welcome.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: So MLS, how has it been?

Sherrie: Hectic!

That's the word to describe it really.

I couldn't really delve into any extracurriculars because of the â€˜shegeâ€™ final year showed me.
I mean, I love saving lives and all but this final year didn't go easy on me.

Anyway, I'm glad I can finally breathe after being underwater for so long.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Iâ€™m glad for you too!

Sherrie: Thank you very much.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: You are into content writing and social media management, how have you been able to keep it going even with all the â€˜shegeâ€™?

Sherrie: I was able to do all those with listsðŸ˜…
I had a book dedicated to my to-do lists.

So before the craziness of the day starts, I open the book and list all the things I need to do.
Time management is essential to get these done actually and discipline, if not, you'd end up not doing anything at all.

I wrote 6 exams this year and I got a job offer while I was about to write the third one, the first professional exams which guaranteed my position as a final-year student, that morning in fact.

It was my first international gig, should I have said no? NeverðŸ˜…. Aside from the pay, the experience was there for me to gain.

Fun fact: I had my interview at the back of the school auditorium because we were all waiting for the result to be pasted in school so I had to wait.

Since I couldn't make it to the hostel in time, I had to settle for the most quiet place then in school ðŸ˜…

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Lmao. This is wild!

Sherrie: I know right!
That's why I have eye-bags most of the timeðŸ˜…

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Sorry about that.
Congratulations on the success of your exam!

Sherrie: Thank you very much.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: To the main purpose of this interview, how have you been able to connect your career as a Medical Laboratory Science student, with what you do in tech? (Thatâ€™s if youâ€™ve made a connection)

Sherrie: I used to think I was merely connecting people with Tech until my good friend, Seven told me I was affiliated with tech since I write especially with my work in GDSC, my excitement couldn't be containedðŸ˜…

Okay okay, Medical Lab is very wide, very very wide so this past 6 months, I made a conscious decision to look for that thing that connects medical lab with tech, safe to say that aside from keeping two worlds as a content connoisseur and the life-saver, I found a course on Global health which includes the use of machine learning and biomedical data in diagnosis.

I enjoyed the course and I am currently pursuing thatðŸ˜Œ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I can relate to the excitement ðŸ˜…

Aliyyah Kalejaye: How has this discovery helped you grow in both fields? Or let me say, how has it made you do things differently?

Sherrie: I have seen firsthand how Artificial intelligence helps in diagnosis which is like the core of medical laboratory science.

I have seen how things can be done differently so I am more exposed and I can say confidently that I have risen above whatever archaic method we still use in our hospitals or better still I am still on that journey.

It has also helped me to identify the lapses we are currently facing and why AI will not take flight anytime soon in LMICs because of the lack of real-time data which is used in making these innovations work.

For example, in the western world, there is an app that can detect melanoma (skin cancer) meanwhile here, it's a whole long process to do that but the interesting thing is, that app cannot detect melanoma in dark-skinned people because of lack of data which caused the inability to factor in dark-skinned people.

I am also able to have a clear path of what I want to do actively, you know.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Knowledge is definitely bliss!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: What are LMICs though?

Sherrie: Low and Middle-Income Countries e.g Nigeria.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Ohh thank you.

Sherrie: You are welcome!!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: I look forward to seeing these technologies fly in Nigeria too though.

Sherrie: It's about time really.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Most definitely.

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Any final words? Anything else you want to share?

Sherrie: Well yeah.
Last words from a multidisciplinary person to anyone who gets to read this.
It's okay to be interested in diverse things, things that are parallel but the key is balance.

I did all these extracurriculars and although my grades did suffer in the hands of my department, I never wavered for once so it's very okay to have interest in diverse things, no pressure though just take things one step at a timeðŸ˜Œ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Words that should be engraved in stone!

Aliyyah Kalejaye: Thank you so much for making time for this and for sharing your knowledge and experience.

Sherrie: Thank you Aliyyah
When the community calls, I answerðŸ˜Œ

Aliyyah Kalejaye: As it should be!

Sherrie: Righttttt

Thatâ€™s all we could take on this interview with my boss. I hope this helps you in making that connection you seek.
